Pipeline for processing pMHC barcodes.

# Quality trimming
Implement this as first step?! Remove sequences that are too short

# A1_cut_adapter.sh
Utilizes adapter trimming program to remove 10x-adapter A-key from reads.
When platform is Iontorrent the A-key is at 5'-end.
Program subsequently also trims away 3' adapters.

# A2_run_longranger.sh
Since pipeline currently consists of single-end reads, a faux read2 file is constructed.
Running longranger basic demultiplexes single cells/GEMs. The GEM barcode is cut out and inserted in sequence header.
Unfortunately, longranger basic also partially removes UMI (3 nt remain for unkown reasons).
Longranger basic is particularly useful in that it does GEM barcode error correction.
The white list of GEM barcodes has to be overwritten with V(D)J barcodes for correct error correction though (must be done once).

# B_clean_longranger_output.sh
Removes the faux read2 sequences.
Removes reads where no GEM barcode was found.
Removes the three remaining nt's of the UMI.

# Cutadaptor naming
Implement a step for naming reads if they contain elements of the barcode construct

# C_cut_adaptor_3p.sh
Should not be used!
Cutting 3' adapter has been included in A1_cut_adapter.sh

# D_run_fastqc
Runs quality checks on all fastq files produced with an experiment processing.
OBS! Is not required for the pipeline.
